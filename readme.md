DISCLAIMER: The following prerequisites are based on the configuration of the M3 Linux Mint attacker machine as provided by the course 2IC80 â€” Lab on Offensive Computer Security, 2022-2023. If your attacker machine does not have the same configuration as M3, your system might require more packages to be installed and/or upgraded.

Installing the software prerequisites:
```
sudo apt-get install python-dev libssl-dev libnetfilter-queue-dev build-essential
```

Installing the Python prerequisites:
```
pip install --upgrade "pip < 21.0"
pip install setuptools
pip install netfilterqueue
pip install scapy
```

Note that the `pip` commands above might require `sudo` to be executed successfully.

### Executing the tool

On a device with Python 2.7 and the prerequisites installed, run the following in your command line:
